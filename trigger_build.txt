Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. 
Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle...and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to kill him.
I—or we machine lifeforms I suppose—have a keen interest in humanity. Love. Family. Religion. War. 
The more human records I unearth, the more charmed I am by their complexity. 
This city is one of many areas I've created out of a desire to understand...to know...humans. 
It's grand, don't you think? Almost...spiritual. And yet, it's nothing more than an android graveyard. 
I seek to learn and and adopt all facets of humanity! Some desire love! Others family! Only then did I realize the truth...the core of humanity...is conflict. 
They fight. Steal. Kill. This is humanity in its purest form!
