Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. 
Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle...and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to kill him.
I—or we machine lifeforms I suppose—have a keen interest in humanity. Love. Family. Religion. War. 
The more human records I unearth, the more charmed I am by their complexity. 
This city is one of many areas I've created out of a desire to understand...to know...humans. 
It's grand, don't you think? Almost...spiritual. And yet, it's nothing more than an android graveyard. 
I seek to learn and and adopt all facets of humanity! Some desire love! Others family! Only then did I realize the truth...the core of humanity...is conflict. 
They fight. Steal. Kill. This is humanity in its purest form!
What is it that separates machines from androids like us? The machines have grown emotions. ...Consciousness. 
The final screams they summoned on the edge of their death... They still echo within me.
The final screams they summoned on the edge of their death... They still echo within me.
My salvation fades away
My body froze in place
Even now, the sky is still so dark
The stopped clocks
The unsounding machines
That my voice could not reach

This is my curse
The depth of the sins I committed
Was your wish
But for embracing this impure soul, I will redeem

And so we right now
Ah, even though it's worthless, I still cry out
The song of that broken world
And so we right now
Ah, even though it's meaningless, I still wish
Just for a future together with you

May your smile on that day... Lovingly disappear...

The overflowing greenery
And the spilling life
Even now, the wind is still so far away
The peeling rust
And the twisting blade
There in the forest where death lurks

This is my curse
The pain of killing a promise
Was your wish
But for throwing away my very last dream, I will atone

And so we right now
Ah, even though it's worthless, I still cry out
The love of this corrupted world
And so we right now
Ah, even though it's meaningless, I still wish
Just for more time together with you

May your drowned consciousness... Gently disappear...

And so we right now
Ah, even though it's worthless, I still cry out
The song of that broken world
And so we right now
Ah, even though it's meaningless, I still wish
Just fr a future together with you

And so we right now
Ah, even though it's worthless, I still cry out
The love of this corrupted world
And so we right now
Ah, even though it's meaningless, I still wish
For more time together with you

Even if my prayers will not grant me forgiveness, I...
